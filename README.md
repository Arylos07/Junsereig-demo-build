# Controls.

WASD to move. Skills menu is controlled by F1. F2 controls equipment. At this time, controller support is only partially supported.

Left CTRL changes camera modes. In Passive mode, use middle mouse button to move the camera. In Active mode, control of the camera is bound to moving the mouse.

Select NPC's and enemies by left clicking. Clicking on another target will target the new target. (in future builds, clicking on nothing will clear all targets)

To attack, press Q to enable targeters and attacks. Holding down left click on enemy will auto attack based on your attack speed. You may also activate targeters by right clicking.

You may resist incoming damage by holding right click (block), however you cannot attack while blocking.

Press F to focus camera North.

To interact, select an object and come close enough. (in the future, this will be replaced with a button press). Not all objects have events to run when interacted with.
